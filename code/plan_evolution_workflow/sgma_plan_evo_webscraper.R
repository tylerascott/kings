#this should be a mod to the sgma_web_scraper that collects 
#each version of the plan 
#as well as the determination letters
#and figures out whether each version was approved or rejected
#based on whether there is a later version than the one in question
#(which means the version in question was rejected)
#or if not, what the current approval status states
